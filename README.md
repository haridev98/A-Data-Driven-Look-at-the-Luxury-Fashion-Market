## Introduction: Exploring the Farfetch Product Catalog
<html>
<body>


<p>Farfetch is a global fashion platform that connects luxury fashion brands and retailers with consumers around the world. The company's website offers a wide selection of luxury fashion products from over 500 brands, including Gucci, Balenciaga, and Prada. Farfetch also offers a variety of services, such as express shipping and free returns.</p>

<p>In this EDA, we will explore the Farfetch Product dataset. The dataset contains information about over 100,000 products, including the product name, price, brand, category, and country of origin. We will use this dataset to answer questions about the popularity of different brands and categories, the average price of products, and the distribution of products by country.</p>

<p>We will also use the dataset to identify any interesting trends or patterns. For example, we could look at how the popularity of brands or categories changes over time, or how the average price of products changes depending on the country of origin.</p>

<p>The goal of this EDA is to gain a better understanding of the Farfetch product catalog. By understanding the popularity of different products, brands, and categories, we can better understand the needs of Farfetch's customers. This information can be used to improve the company's marketing and product offerings.</p>
